This project is the simulation of various digital sequential circuits using Verilog on the Quartus FPGA design software. Each folder conatins a .v file which contains the Verilog code. 
Part 1 is comprised of 3 flip flop registers and a multiplexer.
Part 2 is comprised of a binary counter, two flip flop registers, an adder and a multiplexer.
Part 3 is comprised of a finite state machine control unit, two shift registers, an arithmetic unit that handles multiplication, addidtion and subtraction, two flip flop registers and a multiplexer.
